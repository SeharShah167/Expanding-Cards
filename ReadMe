# Expanding Cards Project

This project demonstrates the creation of expanding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Expanding cards are interactive UI components that enlarge when clicked, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **HTML**: Structured the basic layout of the cards.
- **CSS**: Styled the cards and applied transition effects for smooth expansion.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity to handle the click events and control the card expansion.

## Usage

To view and interact with the expanding cards, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the expanding cards.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles and transition effects for the cards.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling click events and managing the expansion logic.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The cards are defined in `index.html` using `div` elements with a common class.
2. **CSS**: In `styles.css`, each card is styled with default and expanded states, utilizing CSS transitions for smooth animations.
3. **JavaScript**: In `script.js`, event listeners are added to the cards to toggle the expanded state on click.
